 *
 * Four levels, resolved in this order:
 *   1. the project preset's saved color — set by Save as Preset on a device of this template
 *   2. the template's own saved color — set by Save as User Template / Update User Template /
 *      Update as Custom, and stored with the template
 *   3. the project override — `SchematicFile.defaultDeviceHeaderColor`, travels with the file
 *   4. the app preference — localStorage, applies to every project on this machine
 *   5. none of them, which leaves the device with no `headerColor` at all so DeviceNode keeps
 *      painting the theme's `--color-surface` the way it always has
 *
 * A color saved onto a template or a preset is a deliberate statement about *that* device, so
 * it outranks both defaults, which only say what an unopinionated device should look like.
 *
 * The resolved color is *stamped* onto each device as it is created rather than consulted
 * at paint time, so changing any of these never recolors devices already on the canvas.

 * placed, so "the device is showing #8b1a1a" is not on its own evidence that anybody chose
 * #8b1a1a for it. Baking an inherited default into a template or a preset would quietly put
 * that template beyond the reach of the very settings the color came from: the project
 * override would stop working for it, with nothing on screen to say why.
 *
 * So a color is captured when the user picked it here, when the template or preset being
 * written already carried one (an update must not silently erase it), or when it is a color no
 * default explains. A device carrying nothing but the resolved default saves a template with
 * no header color at all — absent stays absent, and such a template leaves the default
 * settings in charge exactly as before (#354).
