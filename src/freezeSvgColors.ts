/**
 * Freeze CSS-variable-based SVG colors to concrete values before an
 * html-to-image capture, then restore them afterwards.
 *
 * Why (#173): connection strokes are inlined as `var(--color-<signal>)` (see
 * `resolveEdgeStroke` in store.ts). html-to-image renders the cloned DOM inside
 * an isolated SVG <foreignObject> whose document does NOT inherit our
 * `:root { --color-* }` custom properties, so in Chromium every `var(--color-…)`
 * stroke resolves to nothing and the line disappears from the PNG/PDF/SVG.
 * (Firefox happens to survive this — hence "Firefox works, Chromium drops lines".)
 * Plain HTML labels use concrete hex colors, so they keep rendering — matching
 * the "lines gone, labels remain" report.
 *
 * Fix: replace each element's `var(...)` inline stroke/fill with its *computed*
 * (already-resolved) color so the clone carries a concrete value. Concrete
 * colors and `url(#gradient)` references are left untouched.
 *
 * Call AFTER `[data-export-capturing]` is set and the style flush has happened,
 * so the frozen colors are the light-mode export values.
 *
 * @returns a restore function that undoes every override.
