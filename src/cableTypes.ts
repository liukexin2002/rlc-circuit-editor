 *
 * The two ends are ordered by HYBRID_CABLE_FAMILY declaration order rather than by drag

 * one pack-list row instead of billing as two SKUs. (Adapter labels stay directional — an

 * commonplace → specialty, so it reads as "LC to opticalCON Fiber"; sorting the labels
 * alphabetically instead would file opticalCON between LC and SC.
