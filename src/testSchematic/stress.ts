/**
 * Generated stress fixture (#383/#384 test-report follow-up, 2026-09-05).
 *
 * The seeded test schematic (#307) is a curated small scene; it can't exercise
 * the failure modes that only appear at scale — mass-selection drags, marquee
 * sweeps over ~100 objects, and large-bounds exports. This scene exists for
 * those: a deterministic grid of SCALE_COLS × SCALE_ROWS two-port devices,
 * chained with connections, spanning wide enough bounds that the export raster
 * caps engage.
 *
 * It is generated in code rather than committed as JSON: nothing in it is
 * hand-curated, and the interesting property is only its size. Load it with
 * `?fixture=stress` (any build) — File ▸ Load Test Schematic stays the curated
 * fixture.
