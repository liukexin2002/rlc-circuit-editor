/**
 * Curated public surface for the EasySchematic developer API reference.
 *
 * TypeDoc reads this file as its entry point and documents whatever's
 * re-exported here. Anything *not* re-exported through this module is
 * treated as internal and stays out of the generated reference.
 *
 * To expose something new in the reference, add it here and rebuild
 * (`npm run docs:dev` regenerates into docs/dist/dev/).
 *
 * Organized by namespace so the generated docs read like a Unity-style
 * Scripting API — `types`, `EdgeRouter`, `PackList`, etc. — rather than a
 * flat dump of every symbol in the repo.
