// LC/SC/ST/opticalCON were made natively compatible, so a mixed fiber run carries NO
// adapter and the single cable spans two different terminations. Deriving the pack-list
// label from one end packs a cable that only lands at one device — "if Joe AV only packs
// an LC fiber cable he won't be able to connect the SC to LC ports."
//
// The rule is deliberately narrow: a combined label is only correct where the two ends
// genuinely need different terminations on ONE cord. Everywhere else a mismatch is
// resolved by an inserted adapter (two separately-labelled cables) or by one connector
// being a superset jack that an ordinary single-type cable already fits. Both halves are
// pinned below so a future "generalisation" can't invent parts that don't exist.
